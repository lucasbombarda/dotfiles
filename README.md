# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the `install.sh` script inside the `scripts` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasbombarda/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
./.dotfiles/scripts/install.sh
```

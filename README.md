# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

## Installation
Just clone the repository at your home directory and run the stow command for the desired configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasbombarda/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow .
```
